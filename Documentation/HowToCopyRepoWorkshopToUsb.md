# How to copy repoWorkshop Folder to Usb Drive

1. Insert a USB drive into your computer.
2. Open the `workshop-cli` folder.
3. Open the `ToolsAfterWorkshop` folder.
4. Locate the file named `copy_to_usb.bat` and double-click it.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions and complete the process.

This will create a folder on your usb drive named `backupWorkshop-(table number)`.

`Note:` If `copy_to_usb.bat` doesn't work and returns a Python error, it is likely because Python is not added to the environment variables.
