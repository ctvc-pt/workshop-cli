# Things to do manually

Before running the CLI, you need to install the following manually:

1. Install `Visual Studio Code`.
2. Install `Ollama`, but do not install any models.
3. Install the specific VS Code extension `pixelbyte-studios.pixelbyte-love2d`
4. Right click on cli shortcut on the desktop, click on `Properties`, go to `Compatibility`, and select the `Run this program as an administrator` option.

## No Issues

If the person closes the CLI prompt, just run the CLI shortcut that is created on the desktop.
